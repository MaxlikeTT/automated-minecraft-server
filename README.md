# automated-minecraft-server
The goal of this project is to fully automate the provisioning, configuration, and setup of your Minecraft server using the tools discussed in this course: Ansible, Terraform, Pulumi, Docker, Scripting, GitHub Actions, AWS, etc. Let me repeat it: your scripts should run without ever connecting to the AWS Management Console.
